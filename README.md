# Bank-Account-Management-System
C++ project that simulates bank transactions.
Also to document my journey learning about TDD (Test Driven Development) as I create multiple tests
to ensure my console application is functional.

Run code with command
1. g++ proj.cpp Account.cpp Person.cpp
2. ./a.out  (OR)  ./a.out < test.txt

Running the (./a.out) executable will give an option to run a Unit Test script or to manually run the program 
while the latter (./a.out < test.txt) will inject a text file into the program to automate the program as End to End Testing.
