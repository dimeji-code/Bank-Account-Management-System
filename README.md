# Bank-Account-Management-System
C++ project that simulates bank transactions.
Also to document my journey learning about TDD (Test Driven Development) as I create multiple tests
to ensure my console application is functional.

Run code with command
1. g++ proj.cpp Account.cpp Person.cpp
2.    
  a. ./a.out
  OR
  b. ./a.out < test.txt

Running the ./a.out executable will give an option to run a unit test script or to manually run the program
while the latter (./a.out < test.txt) will inject a text file into the program to automate the program
